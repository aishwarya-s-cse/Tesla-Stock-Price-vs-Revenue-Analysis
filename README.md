# Tesla-Stock-Price-vs-Revenue-Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project analyzes **Tesla (TSLA)** stock price and revenue trends over time. Using Python libraries like **`yfinance`**, **`pandas`**, and **`plotly`**, we extract historical stock data and revenue figures, clean the data, and visualize it in interactive dashboards. 

The main objective is to provide an insightful comparison of **Tesla’s stock price** versus its **revenue growth**.

## Features
- **Stock Data Extraction**: Retrieves Tesla's historical stock price data using the **`yfinance`** library.
- **Revenue Data Visualization**: Utilizes web scraping (or sample data) to gather and visualize Tesla’s revenue growth.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Provides interactive line charts for stock price vs. time and revenue vs. time using **Plotly**.
- **Data Processing**: Clean, merge, and visualize the data using **`pandas`** and **Plotly** for dynamic visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `yfinance` (for stock data extraction)
  - `pandas` (for data cleaning and manipulation)
  - `plotly` (for interactive visualizations)
- **Data Processing**: Data cleaning and merging using **`pandas`**.
- **Visualization**: Interactive line plots using **Plotly**.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Compare **Tesla’s stock price** with its **revenue** over time.
- Identify any correlations between **market trends** (stock price movements) and **financial performance** (revenue).
